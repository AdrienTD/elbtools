# ELB Tools

This repository contains tools and modding documents for games developed by Etranges Libellules, using their "K" engine.

These games include:
 - Asterix & Obelix XXL
 - Asterix & Obelix XXL2
 - Asterix at the Olympic Games
 - The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon
 - How to Train Your Dragon
 - & more...: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Étranges_Libellules

Currently, this repository includes these tools:
 - Texture viewer
 - RWS to WAV converter
 - Localized text viewer (atm only for XXL2)

These tools have been only tested with files from the PC versions of Asterix XXL2 as well as Olympic Games. As it is possible that the game files have different formats for each platform, it is possible that game files from any platform except Windows will not work, as I only own the PC versions.

The tools also only work on Windows at the moment. The RWS2WAV converter might still be compilable for other systems though. But for the other tools, if you have Linux, use Wine.
